*I am a philosopher working in ethics, ethics of digital technology, and theory of emotion.*

My current research interests include the ethics of emotion, the ethics of affective computing, and moral responsibility (focussing on blame and reactive attitudes).

Additionally, I am interested in metaethics, moral psychology, virtue ethics, moral understanding, political and social philosophy, and philosophical methodology.
