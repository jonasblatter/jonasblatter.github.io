title: "About Me"
---

*I am currently a PhD student at the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Bern and a member of the Swiss Doctoral School in Affective Sciences at the University of Geneva.*

In my doctoral research project I tackle the morality of feeling emotions. I am interested in whether it is possible to wrong another person by feeling a specific emotion towards them. At the moment I am working on my dissertation with the working title “The Morality of Emotion” at the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Bern.

Additionally, I am interested in metaethics, moral psychology, virtue ethics, moral understanding, political and social philosophy, and philosophical methodology.
